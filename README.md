# AI Calci - The Future of Handwriting Calculations

**AI Calci** is an innovative calculator application that brings math to life by turning handwritten notes into digital equations, solving problems, and even interpreting complex scenarios and abstract concepts! Whether you're solving simple arithmetic or complex equations, this app does it all—right from your browser.

### Features:
- **Handwriting Recognition**: Converts your handwritten notes into digital equations in real-time.
- **Advanced Calculation**: Solves basic arithmetic to complex physics scenarios like car crashes or abstract questions like "What came first, the chicken or the egg?"
- **Graphing and Visualization**: Automatically graphs equations and visualizes problems.
- **Abstract Concept Detection**: Draw symbols or objects, and watch the app interpret them creatively (e.g., Captain America's shield or Newton’s apple).
- **Cross-Platform**: Available on the web for all devices—no need to be tied to an iPad or any specific OS.
- **Interactive Drawing Canvas**: Use a canvas to draw, solve equations, or pose questions that the AI interprets.
- **Color Customization**: A flexible color palette allows users to personalize their drawing experience.
- **Python Backend with FastAPI**: Supports complex mathematical evaluations and integrates Google’s Gemini API for advanced AI functionality.
- **Latex Support**: Renders complex mathematical expressions beautifully using MathJax.

### Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN components, Mantine library.
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Google Gemini API.
- **Additional Tools**: Latex rendering for expressions, interactive canvas using React hooks.

### Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` for the frontend and set up the Python environment for the backend.
3. Run the project with `npm run dev` for the frontend and start the Python server.
